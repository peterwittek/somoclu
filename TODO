  - Integration with data structures of SOM libraries in Python, R, and MATLAB.
  - Persistent object in C++ to improve efficiency of wrappers.
  - Improve documentation of wrappers. Python documentation should go to https://readthedocs.org/.
  - Pass a single-precision array from R without making a copy.
  - Upload to MATLAB FileExchange.
  - Reimplement GPU kernels in CUDA to replace Thrust (testing is currently in cuda_opt branch).
