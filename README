GPU-Accelerated MapReduce-Based Self-Organizing Maps

You will need CUDA, MPI, and MR-MPI to compile the code. Example usage with two GPUs:

mpirun -np 2 ./mrsom data/rgbs.txt data/rgbs


The code was derived from the MR-MPI SOM implementation by Seung-Jin Sul:

The GPU setting method for a distributed system is based on GPMR by Jeff Stuart:
