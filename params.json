{"name":"Somoclu","tagline":"Self-organizing maps on a cluster","body":"Somoclu\r\n==\r\nSomoclu is a cluster-oriented implementation of self-organizing maps. It relies on MPI for distributing the workload, and it can be accelerated by CUDA on a GPU cluster. A sparse kernel is also included, which is useful for training maps on vector spaces generated in text mining processes.\r\n\r\nUsage\r\n==\r\nSomoclu takes a plain text input file -- either dense or sparse data. Example files are included.\r\n\r\n    $ [mpirun -np NPROC] somoclu [OPTIONs] INPUT_FILE OUTPUT_PREFIX\r\n\r\nArguments:\r\n\r\n    -c FILENAME              Specify an initial codebook for the map.\r\n    -e NUMBER                Maximum number of epochs\r\n    -k NUMBER                Kernel type\r\n                                0: Dense CPU\r\n                                1: Dense GPU\r\n                                2: Sparse CPU\r\n    -m NUMBER                Map type\r\n                                0: Planar\r\n                                1: Toroid\r\n    -r NUMBER                Initial radius (default: half the number of columns)\r\n    -s                       Enable snapshots of U-matrix\r\n    -x, --columns NUMBER     Number of columns in map (size of SOM in direction x)\r\n    -y, --rows    NUMBER     Number of rows in map (size of SOM in direction y)\r\n\r\nExamples:\r\n\r\n    $ somoclu data/rgbs.txt data/rgbs\r\n    $ mpirun -np 4 somoclu -k 0 --rows 20 --columns 20 data/rgbs.txt data/rgbs\r\n\r\nInput File Formats\r\n==\r\nOne sparse and two dense data formats are supported. All of them are plain text files. The entries can be separated by any white-space character. One row represents one data instance across all formats. Comment lines starting with a hash mark are ignored.\r\n\r\nThe sparse format follows the [libsvm](http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvm/) guidelines. The first feature is zero-indexed. For instance, the vector [ 1.2 0 0 3.4] is represented as the following line in the file:\r\n0:1.2 3:3.4. The file is parsed twice: once to get the number of instances and features, and the second time to read the data in the individual threads.\r\n\r\nThe basic dense format includes the coordinates of the data vectors, separated by a white-space. Just like the sparse format, this file is parsed twice to get the basic dimensions right. \r\n\r\nThe .lrn file of [Databionic ESOM Tools](http://databionic-esom.sourceforge.net/) is also accepted and it is parsed only once. The format is described as follows:\r\n\r\n% n\r\n\r\n% m\r\n\r\n% s1\t\ts2\t\t\t..\t\tsm\r\n\r\n% var_name1\tvar_name2\t\t..\t\tvar_namem\t\r\n\r\nx11\t\tx12\t\t\t..\t\tx1m\r\n\r\nx21\t\tx22\t\t\t..\t\tx2m\r\n\r\n.\t\t.\t\t\t.\t\t.\r\n\r\n.\t\t.\t\t\t.\t\t.\r\n\r\nxn1\t\txn2\t\t\t..\t\txnm\r\n\r\nHere n is the number of rows in the file, that is, the number of data instances. Parameter m defines the number of columns in the file. The next row defines the column mask: the value 1 for a column means the column should be used in the training. Note that the first column in this format is always a unique key, so this should have the value 9 in the column mask. The row with the variable names is ignore by Somoclu. The elements of the matrix follow -- from here, the file is identical to the basic dense format, with the addition of the first column as the unique key.\r\n\r\nIf the input file is sparse, but a dense kernel is invoked, Somoclu will execute and results will be incorrect. Invoking a sparse kernel on a dense input file is likely to lead to a segmentation fault.\r\n\r\nVisualisation\r\n==\r\nThe primary purpose of generating a map is visualisation. Somoclu does not come with its own functions for visualisation, since there are numerous generic tools that are capable of plotting high-quality figures. A simplot gnuplot script is provided with the source code as plot_som.gp. This script takes a U-matrix (umat.umx), and outputs a plot (som.png).\r\n\r\nThe output formats of the U-matrix and the codebook are compatible with [Databionic ESOM Tools](http://databionic-esom.sourceforge.net/) for more advanced visualisation.\r\n\r\nDependencies\r\n==\r\nYou need a working MPI installation on your system to compile Somoclu. A single-core or a single-GPU variant will run without the MPI runtime. The package was tested with OpenMPI, but it should work with other MPI flavours. \r\n\r\nCUDA support is optional. CUDA 4.1 and 5.0 versions are known to work.\r\n\r\nCompilation & Installation\r\n==\r\nFrom GIT repository first run\r\n\r\n    $ ./autogen.sh\r\n\r\nThen follow the standard POSIX procedure:\r\n\r\n    $ ./configure [options]\r\n    $ make\r\n    $ make install\r\n\r\n\r\nOptions for configure\r\n\r\n    --prefix=PATH           Set directory prefix for installation\r\n\r\n\r\nBy default Somoclu is installed into /usr/local. If you prefer a\r\ndifferent location, use this option to select an installation\r\ndirectory.\r\n\r\n    --with-mpi-compilers=DIR or --with-mpi-compilers=yes\r\n                              use MPI compiler (mpicxx) found in directory DIR, or\r\n                              in your PATH if =yes\r\n    --with-mpi=MPIROOT      use MPI root directory.\r\n    --with-mpi-libs=\"LIBS\"  MPI libraries [default \"-lmpi\"]\r\n    --with-mpi-incdir=DIR   MPI include directory [default MPIROOT/include]\r\n    --with-mpi-libdir=DIR   MPI library directory [default MPIROOT/lib]\r\n\r\nThe above flags allow the identification of the correct MPI library the user wishes to use. The flags are especially useful if MPI is installed in a non-standard location, or when multiple MPI libraries are available.\r\n\r\n    --with-cuda=/path/to/cuda           Set path for CUDA\r\n\r\nSomoclu looks for CUDA in /usr/local/cuda. If your installation is not there, then specify the path with this parameter. If you do not want CUDA enabled, set the parameter to ```--without-cuda```.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
